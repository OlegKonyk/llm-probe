I forgot my password and the reset link isn't working.\n\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me help you with that. Can I have your email address please?\n\nCustomer: Sure, it's john.smith@email.com\n\nAgent: Thank you. I can see your account here. The issue is that your email address on file was slightly different - it had an extra dot. I've updated it now. Let me send you a new password reset link.\n\nCustomer: Oh, that makes sense. I recently changed my email.\n\nAgent: The reset link has been sent to john.smith@email.com. You should receive it within a few minutes. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nCustomer: No, that's all. Thank you so much!\n\nAgent: You're welcome! Have a great day.",
