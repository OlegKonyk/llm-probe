  "transcript": "Agent: Thank you for calling product support. How may I assist you?\n\nCustomer: Yeah, hi. I'm really frustrated. I bought your wireless headphones three weeks ago and they keep disconnecting every few minutes. It's unusable.\n\nAgent: I'm very sorry to hear you're experiencing that issue. That's definitely not the experience we want you to have. Let me help troubleshoot this. Have you tried resetting the headphones?\n\nCustomer: Yes, I've tried everything. I've reset them, updated the firmware, tried different devices. Nothing works.\n\nAgent: I appreciate you trying those steps. Can I have your order number so I can look up your purchase?\n\nCustomer: It's ORD-445821.\n\nAgent: Thank you. I see you purchased these on March 15th. Since troubleshooting hasn't resolved the issue and you're within our 30-day return window, I have two options for you. We can either send you a replacement pair with expedited shipping, or process a full refund.\n\nCustomer: Honestly, at this point I just want my money back. I don't trust this product anymore.\n\nAgent: I completely understand. I'll process a full refund to your original payment method. You'll see it within 3-5 business days. I'll also email you a prepaid return shipping label. Just send the headphones back in any box.\n\nCustomer: Okay, that works. Will I get the full amount back?\n\nAgent: Yes, you'll receive a full refund of $149.99. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nCustomer: No, that's it. Thanks for handling this quickly.\n\nAgent: You're welcome, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience.",
